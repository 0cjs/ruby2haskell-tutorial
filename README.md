Introduction
------------

This repository contains the slides, notes and support materials for
the presentation/tutorial _From Ruby to Haskell: An Introduction_,
first given in Tokyo on 2013-01-22. The event details may still be
available on the [event page][event].

Two versions of the ouput slides are available at the top level of this
repository:

* [slides.pdf]: The slides for the presentation.
* [notes.pdf]: My speaking notes for the presentation. This more or less
  covers my lecture, though not of course any of the Q&A with the audience.

[notes.pdf]: https://github.com/cjs-cynic-net/ruby2haskell-tutorial/blob/master/notes.pdf

The presentation was done in LaTeX using the beamer package; the source
for the presentation and a script to build it are under the src/
subdirectory. Feel free to steal from this if you're doing your own
presentation on whatever topic, since it may save you quite some time.

Feel free to contact me at <cjs@cynic.net> if you have any questions
either about the content of the presentation or how it was done in LaTeX
and beamer.

Using the Examples
------------------

To work through the examples given during the tutorial, you will need
the following software installed on your computer:

* Git
* A text editor
* A Ruby implementation including an interpreter (version 1.8 or 1.9
  of the original "Matz" ruby is fine)
* The Glasgow Haskell Compiler (and interpreter)

You will also need to be familiar with using Git and your editor.

Familiarity with Ruby is not strictly required, but will be quite
useful. If you don't know Ruby, consider teaming up with someone else in
the tutorial who does and can help you out with code and concepts you
don't understand.

The examples and code given here were developed and tested under Ubuntu
Linux, but should work just fine under other versions of Linux, MacOS
and Windows (though under MacOS and Windows you will need to have a
little bit of familiarity with the command line interface).

Software Sources
----------------

#### Git

Git is typically available through the packaging system used with your
OS (except Windows); for example, the command `sudo apt-get install
git-core` will install it on Ubuntu Linux systems. If it is not, you can
download a client from [here][git-clients]. If you typically use a GUI
for file manipulation, you may also wish to download a GUI interface,
such as [TortoiseGit for Windows][tortoisegit].

[git-clients]: http://git-scm.com/downloads
[tortoisegit]: https://code.google.com/p/tortoisegit/

#### Ruby

Being a Rubyist, you should have Ruby already installed on your system.
We use the Matz interpreter, which is the original Ruby implementation,
but if you're more comfortable with another one, that will do as well.
You will probably want the interactive ruby interpreter, irb, available
as we use that in many of the early examples.

#### GHC

GHC (the Glasgow Haskell Compiler, which includes an interpreter) is
also typically available as a package; `sudo apt-get install ghc` will
install it under Ubuntu Linux. (Though it's often an older version,
that's fine for this tutorial.) Under OSX, if you are using brew, you can
use `brew install haskell-platform`.

If not available as a package, you can download the [Haskell
Platform][haskplat] from [5], which will give you both GHC and a wide
set of commonly used libraries. GHC binaries are also available from the
[GHC home page][ghc] if for some reason the Haskell Platform doesn't
work for you.

[haskplat]: http://www.haskell.org/platform/
[ghc]: http://www.haskell.org/ghc/

Testing Your Installation
-------------------------

To test that the interpreter is working, type `ghci` at the command line
prompt. You should see something resembling the following output:

    GHCi, version 7.4.1: http://www.haskell.org/ghc/  :? for help
    Loading package ghc-prim ... linking ... done.
    Loading package integer-gmp ... linking ... done.
    Loading package base ... linking ... done.
    Prelude>

Typing `:q` at the GHCI prompt will quit back to the command line:

    Prelude> :q
    Leaving GHCi.

To test that the load-and-go compiler is properly installed, change to
the directory containing this README file and type `runghc Main.hs`.
(This command compiles the given source code file and then runs it.) It
should print "Hello, world." and return you to the command line prompt.
Feel free to change the string to something else and re-run the program
to verify that you're comfortable with your edit/run cycle.

Further Reading
---------------

If you'd like to learn more about Haskell, the book I most strongly
recommend is Graham Hutton's [_Programming in Haskell_.][hutton] It's
short but concisely covers a great deal of what you need to know to use
the language effectively.
